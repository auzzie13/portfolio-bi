        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I began my career in athletic training after earning a Bachelor of
            Science in Health and Human Performance from Middle Tennessee State
            University. Over nearly a decade, I worked across every level of
            athletics—from secondary schools to NCAA football, MLS soccer, and
            the NFL. My final role in the field was serving as the Clinical
            Coordinator of Event Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical
            Center, where I led medical logistics and staffing for over 40
            contracted events including TSSAA state championships.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2019, I pivoted into software development, completing Vanderbilt
            University’s Full Stack Web Development program in early 2020. After
            navigating a difficult job market during the COVID-19 pandemic, I
            joined an NIH-funded research group at Vanderbilt University Medical
            Center as a software developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my current role, I build and manage REDCap databases for
            large-scale clinical studies, develop Tableau dashboards to
            visualize research metrics, and create automated pipelines to move
            data from third-party tools like Fitbit into secure REDCap
            environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I recently attended the 2025 Tableau Conference and left inspired by
            what’s possible at the intersection of business intelligence and
            software development. My unique background as a full stack developer
            and Tableau creator allows me to build scalable, data-driven tools
            that are both technically sound and user-friendly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm known for my strong work ethic, problem-solving mindset, and
            ability to quickly adapt and learn—skills I've honed through my
            coding bootcamp, self-driven learning, and professional transitions.
            I’m excited to bring that energy to a team where I can make an
            impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s connect—I'd love to hear how I can contribute to your
            organization.
